\begin{abstract}
\textbf{Abstract}: This work applies logistic regression using gradient descent and linear discriminant analysis to the tasks of predicting breast cancer tumor types and red wine quality. The analytic methods of logistic regression using gradient descent and linear discriminant analysis are compared and it is shown that linear discriminant analysis is more effective and efficient for binary classification tasks. We also demonstrate how gradient descent hyperparameters affect convergence rate and the quality of the obtained results.

\section{\label{sec:level1}Introduction}
\subsection*{\label{sec:level2}Preliminaries}
Logistic regression is a common regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary). 

\subsection{\label{sec:level2}Second-level heading: Formatting}

This file may be formatted in both the \texttt{preprint} (the default) and
\texttt{reprint} styles; the latter format may be used to 
mimic final journal output. Either format may be used for submission
purposes; however, for peer review and production, AIP will format the
article using the \texttt{preprint} class option. Hence, it is
essential that authors check that their manuscripts format acceptably
under \texttt{preprint}. Manuscripts submitted to AIP that do not
format correctly under the \texttt{preprint} option may be delayed in
both the editorial and production processes.

The \texttt{widetext} environment will make the text the width of the
full page, as on page~\pageref{eq:wideeq}. (Note the use the
\verb+\pageref{#1}+ to get the page number right automatically.) The
width-changing commands only take effect in \texttt{twocolumn}
formatting. It has no effect if \texttt{preprint} formatting is chosen
instead.

\subsubsection{\label{sec:level3}Third-level heading: Citations and Footnotes}

Citations in text refer to entries in the Bibliography;
they use the commands \verb+\cite{#1}+ or \verb+\onlinecite{#1}+. 
Because REV\TeX\ uses the \verb+natbib+ package of Patrick Daly, 
its entire repertoire of commands are available in your document;
see the \verb+natbib+ documentation for further details.
The argument of \verb+\cite+ is a comma-separated list of \emph{keys};
a key may consist of letters and numerals. 

By default, citations are numerical; \cite{feyn54} author-year citations are an option. 
To give a textual citation, use \verb+\onlinecite{#1}+: (Refs.~\onlinecite{witten2001,epr,Bire82}). 
REV\TeX\ ``collapses'' lists of consecutive numerical citations when appropriate. 
REV\TeX\ provides the ability to properly punctuate textual citations in author-year style;
this facility works correctly with numerical citations only with \texttt{natbib}'s compress option turned off. 
To illustrate, we cite several together \cite{feyn54,witten2001,epr,Berman1983}, 
and once again (Refs.~\onlinecite{epr,feyn54,Bire82,Berman1983}). 
Note that, when numerical citations are used, the references were sorted into the same order they appear in the bibliography. 

A reference within the bibliography is specified with a \verb+\bibitem{#1}+ command,
where the argument is the citation key mentioned above. 
\verb+\bibitem{#1}+ commands may be crafted by hand or, preferably,
generated by using Bib\TeX. 
The AIP styles for REV\TeX~4 include Bib\TeX\ style files
\verb+aipnum.bst+ and \verb+aipauth.bst+, appropriate for
numbered and author-year bibliographies,
respectively. 
REV\TeX~4 will automatically choose the style appropriate for 
the document's selected class options: the default is numerical, and
you obtain the author-year style by specifying a class option of \verb+author-year+.

This sample file demonstrates a simple use of Bib\TeX\ 
via a \verb+\bibliography+ command referencing the \verb+aipsamp.bib+ file.
Running Bib\TeX\ (in this case \texttt{bibtex
aipsamp}) after the first pass of \LaTeX\ produces the file
\verb+aipsamp.bbl+ which contains the automatically formatted
\verb+\bibitem+ commands (including extra markup information via
\verb+\bibinfo+ commands). If not using Bib\TeX, the
\verb+thebibiliography+ environment should be used instead.

\paragraph{Fourth-level heading is run in.}%
Footnotes are produced using the \verb+\footnote{#1}+ command. 
Numerical style citations put footnotes into the 
bibliography\footnote{Automatically placing footnotes into the bibliography requires using BibTeX to compile the bibliography.}.
Author-year and numerical author-year citation styles (each for its own reason) cannot use this method. 
Note: due to the method used to place footnotes in the bibliography, \emph{you
must re-run BibTeX every time you change any of your document's
footnotes}. 

\section{Math and Equations}
Inline math may be typeset using the \verb+$+ delimiters. Bold math
symbols may be achieved using the \verb+bm+ package and the
\verb+\bm{#1}+ command it supplies. For instance, a bold $\alpha$ can
be typeset as \verb+$\bm{\alpha}$+ giving $\bm{\alpha}$. Fraktur and
Blackboard (or open face or double struck) characters should be
typeset using the \verb+\mathfrak{#1}+ and \verb+\mathbb{#1}+ commands
respectively. Both are supplied by the \texttt{amssymb} package. For
example, \verb+$\mathbb{R}$+ gives $\mathbb{R}$ and
\verb+$\mathfrak{G}$+ gives $\mathfrak{G}$

In \LaTeX\ there are many different ways to display equations, and a
few preferred ways are noted below. Displayed math will center by
default. Use the class option \verb+fleqn+ to flush equations left.

Below we have numbered single-line equations, the most common kind: 
\begin{eqnarray}
\chi_+(p)\alt{\bf [}2|{\bf p}|(|{\bf p}|+p_z){\bf ]}^{-1/2}
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
|{\bf p}|+p_z\\
px+ip_y
\end{array}\right)\;,
\\
\left\{%
 \openone234567890abc123\alpha\beta\gamma\delta1234556\alpha\beta
 \frac{1\sum^{a}_{b}}{A^2}%
\right\}%
\label{eq:one}.
\end{eqnarray}
Note the open one in Eq.~(\ref{eq:one}).

Not all numbered equations will fit within a narrow column this
way. The equation number will move down automatically if it cannot fit
on the same line with a one-line equation:
\begin{equation}
\left\{
 ab12345678abc123456abcdef\alpha\beta\gamma\delta1234556\alpha\beta
 \frac{1\sum^{a}_{b}}{A^2}%
\right\}.
\end{equation}

When the \verb+\label{#1}+ command is used [cf. input for
Eq.~(\ref{eq:one})], the equation can be referred to in text without
knowing the equation number that \TeX\ will assign to it. Just
use \verb+\ref{#1}+, where \verb+#1+ is the same name that used in
the \verb+\label{#1}+ command.

Unnumbered single-line equations can be typeset
using the \verb+\[+, \verb+\]+ format:
\[g^+g^+ \rightarrow g^+g^+g^+g^+ \dots ~,~~q^+q^+\rightarrow
q^+g^+g^+ \dots ~. \]

\subsection{Multiline equations}

Multiline equations are obtained by using the \verb+eqnarray+
environment.  Use the \verb+\nonumber+ command at the end of each line
to avoid assigning a number:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal M}=&&ig_Z^2(4E_1E_2)^{1/2}(l_i^2)^{-1}
\delta_{\sigma_1,-\sigma_2}
(g_{\sigma_2}^e)^2\chi_{-\sigma_2}(p_2)\nonumber\\
&&\times
[\epsilon_jl_i\epsilon_i]_{\sigma_1}\chi_{\sigma_1}(p_1),
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum \vert M^{\text{viol}}_g \vert ^2&=&g^{2n-4}_S(Q^2)~N^{n-2}
        (N^2-1)\nonumber \\
 & &\times \left( \sum_{i<j}\right)
  \sum_{\text{perm}}
 \frac{1}{S_{12}}
 \frac{1}{S_{12}}
 \sum_\tau c^f_\tau~.
\end{eqnarray}
\textbf{Note:} Do not use \verb+\label{#1}+ on a line of a multiline
equation if \verb+\nonumber+ is also used on that line. Incorrect
cross-referencing will result. Notice the use \verb+\text{#1}+ for
using a Roman font within a math environment.

To set a multiline equation without \emph{any} equation
numbers, use the \verb+\begin{eqnarray*}+,
\verb+\end{eqnarray*}+ format:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum \vert M^{\text{viol}}_g \vert ^2&=&g^{2n-4}_S(Q^2)~N^{n-2}
        (N^2-1)\\
 & &\times \left( \sum_{i<j}\right)
 \left(
  \sum_{\text{perm}}\frac{1}{S_{12}S_{23}S_{n1}}
 \right)
 \frac{1}{S_{12}}~.
\end{eqnarray*}
To obtain numbers not normally produced by the automatic numbering,
use the \verb+\tag{#1}+ command, where \verb+#1+ is the desired
equation number. For example, to get an equation number of
(\ref{eq:mynum}),
\begin{equation}
g^+g^+ \rightarrow g^+g^+g^+g^+ \dots ~,~~q^+q^+\rightarrow
q^+g^+g^+ \dots ~. \tag{2.6$'$}\label{eq:mynum}
\end{equation}

A few notes on \verb=\tag{#1}=. \verb+\tag{#1}+ requires
\texttt{amsmath}. The \verb+\tag{#1}+ must come before the
\verb+\label{#1}+, if any. The numbering set with \verb+\tag{#1}+ is
\textit{transparent} to the automatic numbering in REV\TeX{};
therefore, the number must be known ahead of time, and it must be
manually adjusted if other equations are added. \verb+\tag{#1}+ works
with both single-line and multiline equations. \verb+\tag{#1}+ should
only be used in exceptional case - do not use it to number all
equations in a paper.

Enclosing single-line and multiline equations in
\verb+\begin{subequations}+ and \verb+\end{subequations}+ will produce
a set of equations that are ``numbered'' with letters, as shown in
Eqs.~(\ref{subeq:1}) and (\ref{subeq:2}) below:
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:whole}
\begin{equation}
\left\{
 abc123456abcdef\alpha\beta\gamma\delta1234556\alpha\beta
 \frac{1\sum^{a}_{b}}{A^2}
\right\},\label{subeq:1}
\end{equation}
\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal M}=&&ig_Z^2(4E_1E_2)^{1/2}(l_i^2)^{-1}
(g_{\sigma_2}^e)^2\chi_{-\sigma_2}(p_2)\nonumber\\
&&\times
[\epsilon_i]_{\sigma_1}\chi_{\sigma_1}(p_1).\label{subeq:2}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
Putting a \verb+\label{#1}+ command right after the
\verb+\begin{subequations}+, allows one to
reference all the equations in a subequations environment. For
example, the equations in the preceding subequations environment were
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:whole}).

\subsubsection{Wide equations}
The equation that follows is set in a wide format, i.e., it spans
across the full page. The wide format is reserved for long equations
that cannot be easily broken into four lines or less:
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}
{\cal R}^{(\text{d})}=
 g_{\sigma_2}^e
 \left(
   \frac{[\Gamma^Z(3,21)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{12}^2-M_W^2}
  +\frac{[\Gamma^Z(13,2)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{13}^2-M_W^2}
 \right)
 + x_WQ_e
 \left(
   \frac{[\Gamma^\gamma(3,21)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{12}^2-M_W^2}
  +\frac{[\Gamma^\gamma(13,2)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{13}^2-M_W^2}
 \right)\;. \label{eq:wideeq}
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
This is typed to show the output is in wide format.
(Since there is no input line between \verb+\equation+ and
this paragraph, there is no paragraph indent for this paragraph.)
